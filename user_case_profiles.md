# User Case Profiles 

Rita's User Case Profile: 
Researchers that are in the field of engineering protein sensors in which they need to use a model for molecular docking. These researchers want to evaluate which model will be best to use for their user case and see if there is any discrepancy amongst software tools. These researchers want an easy way to evaluate different models within a reasonable timeline. They are very technical but some researchers may be less fluent in the 'dry lab' sector having spent most of their expertise in the wet lab. 

Walter's User Case Profile:

Ana is a structural biology graduate student researcher. She wants to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between proteins of interests in her set of PDB files. Ana prefers to use PyMol to visualize her structures. Ana does not want to spend too much on searching for the right PPI tailored to her specific research question. Her background is laboratory-oriented, and she doesn't know the first thing about programming.
