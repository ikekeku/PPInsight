# User Case Profiles 

Rita's User Case Profile: 
Researchers that are in the field of engineering protein sensors in which they need to use a model for molecular docking. These researchers want to evaluate which model will be best to use for their user case and see if there is any discrepancy amongst software tools. These researchers want an easy way to evaluate different models within a reasonable timeline. They are very technical but some researchers may be less fluent in the 'dry lab' sector having spent most of their expertise in the wet lab. 

Walter's User Case Profile:

Ana is a structural biology graduate student researcher. She wants to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between proteins of interests in her set of PDB files. Ana prefers to use PyMol to visualize her structures. Ana does not want to spend too much on searching for the right PPI tailored to her specific research question. Her background is laboratory-oriented, and she doesn't know the first thing about programming.

Ike's User Case Profile:
Huey is a graduate student. He wants to create FASTA files for a list of proteins his lab is researching. He wants a fast and efficient way to obtain these files without spending hours searching for every single one. His project requires that he's knowledgeable in protein metadata.
Ruth is an undergraduate student. She is interested in computational modeling for proteins, as she's heard a lot about AlphaFold and is interested in protein complex design. She wants to know the typical outputs of these models, and how they vary between each other. She's completely new to the field and is only familiar with a few proteins.
