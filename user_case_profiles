# User Case Profiles 

Rita's User Case Profile: 
Researchers that are in the field of engineering protein sensors in which they need to use a model for molecular docking. These researchers want to evaluate which model will be best to use for their user case and see if there is any discrepancy amongst software tools. These researchers want an easy way to evaluate different models within a reasonable timeline. They are very technical but some researchers may be less fluent in the 'dry lab' sector having spent most of their expertise in the wet lab.
