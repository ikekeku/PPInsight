# User Case Profiles 

Stella is an undergrad in the last year of her biochemistry major working in a lab that studies PPIs. She wants to compare her models to previous work in the literature for her senior thesis. Stella wants a streamlined tool that won't take too much time to use since she is already busy with her coursework. Her protein knowledge is up to the level of a biochem BS, but she has very little familiarity with code outside of the specialized programs that she uses for computational PPI research.

Gustav is an industry research scientist. He will use the software to author a metaanalysis on computational PPI research. He wants a great deal of flexibility and plenty of features and doesn't mind if it takes a while as long as he gets reliable, innovative results. He has a PhD in bioinformatics and is very familiar with Python, R, and bash.
