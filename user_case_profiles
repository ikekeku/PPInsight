### Walter's
Ana is a structural biology graduate student researcher. She wants to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between proteins of interests in her set of PDB files. Ana prefers to use PyMol to visualize her structures. Ana does not want to spend too much on searching for the right PPI tailored to her specific research question. Her background is laboratory-oriented, and she doesn't know the first thing about programming.
