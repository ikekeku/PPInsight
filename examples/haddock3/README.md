This folder contains sample output from the HADDOCK3 tutorial (https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md) for the purpose of buildling Task #3 of PPInsight.
'run1-test' is a result of running the following commands after correctly installing HADDOCK3 (refer to USAGE.md for additional help):
```bash
cd examples/docking-protein-protein
haddock3 docking-protein-protein-test.cfg
```
The parent directories (e.g., '/examples' and '/docking-protein-protein') are not included in this directory.
**The values we want are in the 'analysis' directory, stored as '.tsv' files.**
